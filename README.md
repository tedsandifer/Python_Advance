Project Title: Camera Suite

Description:
Camera Creation /Manager Gui that will build a camera with rig. 
Each created camera and rig will have a unique name. 
After the camera has been created, a separate tab will have quick selection for rig components and text fields to enter data. 
The manager tab will have a pull down list of all the cameras in the scene that can be loaded and utilized.
The manager tab gui will also feature many camera-specific functions such as: depth of field, focal length, near and far clipping, etc.

Thanks so much for checking out my camera suite!
