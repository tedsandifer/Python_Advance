Style is first and foremost there to create readable and undestableable code.
Perfect for coming back to it in the near future and doing maintenance or updates.
Easy readability is measured by you and your team.
The best way to achieve it is to follow standards
while still experimenting with better ways to express yourself.
Make coding standards your baseline and advance from there.



#************************************************************************************
# 21. STYLE load
#************************************************************************************
Update the style of this module: arload.py
Use what you have learned.





#************************************************************************************
# 22. STYLE logger
#************************************************************************************
Update the style of this module: pylogger.py
Focus on readability of the function without the need to understand every part.
It should be easy for everyone to pick it up and modify it.





#************************************************************************************
# 23. LESS loops/ifs/calls
#************************************************************************************
a) Update compress_ifs.py in terms of the 'if' uses and style rules.

b) Find a module in your application with a lot of ifs, loops or function calls.
   See if you can update it in a way that needs significantly less lines of code.

TIP: Calls or ifs can often be replaced with loops.
