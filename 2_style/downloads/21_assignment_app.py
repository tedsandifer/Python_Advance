# 24. STYLE module
#************************************************************************************
Let's use our newly learned style knowledge to update your application.

   a) Copy your application into "5_app" (if not already)

   b) Commit as "INIT 2_style"

   c) Update the style of your application and include

      * module header
      * docString

   d) Commit as "DONE 2_style" and push the updated version to "main/master".

   e) Check out the differences after you're finished: Before vs after
      Does it look feel better and is easier to read?










#************************************************************************************
# 25. DOCUMENTATION
#************************************************************************************
Write an advanced documentation on the remote git Wiki for your application.
e.g. https://github.com/alexanderrichtertd/plex/wiki

Include two documentation pages in your Wiki or README.md:

One for
a) an artist who wants to use the tool.
   Make it visual with images, gifs and even videos.

b) and one for a developer who wants to modify your module.
   Make its how-to and ins and outs clear.




Mark Twain once said:
“I didn't have time to write a short letter,
so I wrote a long one instead.”

Mark Twain suggested that writing a hundred words requires more mental effort than writing a thousand
— particularly if you want it to be meaningful.
Don't waste your readers' time by writing things without a clear motivation.
Each line must count and help with a particular step or question.
Don’t be afraid of revisions and ask others for feedback.
